## Workflows - ML Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion**: Collect and load data from various sources. This step involves reading data from files, databases, or APIs and storing it in a format suitable for further processing.
2. **Data Validation**: Validate the data to ensure quality and consistency. This step includes checking for missing values, data types, and other anomalies that could affect the model's performance.
3. **Data Transformation**: Transform the data into a suitable format for modeling. This step involves feature engineering, scaling, encoding categorical variables, and other preprocessing tasks.
4. **Model Trainer**: Train machine learning models on the transformed data. This step involves selecting algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and training the models.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained models. This step includes calculating metrics, cross-validation, and comparing different models to select the best one.
